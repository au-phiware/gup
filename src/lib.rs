//! # Gup - GPU-Accelerated Data Visualization Library
//!
//! Gup is a high-performance data visualization library that leverages GPU acceleration through
//! WebGPU to create interactive, scalable visualizations that work both natively and in web
//! browsers.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: Utilizes WebGPU for high-performance graphics
//! - **Cross-Platform**: Works on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and web (WebAssembly)
//! - **Interactive Visualizations**: Built-in support for user interactions and animations
//! - **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allowing custom marks and interactions
